When using the dropdown in the toolbar, currently the dropdown only opens when clicking the icon. I want it to also open when clicking the dropdown name. Additionally, the checkbox in the dropdown works when clicking the name, but not when clicking the checkbox itself for items inside the dropdown. Also, the text inside the dropdown is not fully visible due to padding issuesâ€”please fix this as well.
