# Plan to Add Search and Enhanced Selection to MultiSelectComboBox

This document outlines the plan to add search functionality and an improved selection display to the `MultiSelectComboBox` widget.

## 1. `app/ui/components/multi_select_combobox.py`

The `MultiSelectComboBox` will be significantly enhanced to provide a better user experience.

### `__init__` Method

-   A new `QWidget` will be created to serve as the main container for the dropdown's view.
-   This container widget will have a `QVBoxLayout`.
-   A `QLineEdit` will be added at the top of the layout to act as a search bar.
-   Below the search bar, a `QWidget` with a `QHBoxLayout` or a `QFlowLayout` (a custom layout that wraps items) will be added to display the selected items as tags with a deselect button.
-   The main `QListWidget` containing all the items will be placed below the selected items area.
-   The `textChanged` signal of the search bar will be connected to a new `_filter_items` method.

### `_filter_items` Method

-   This new method will be responsible for filtering the items in the main `QListWidget` based on the text entered in the search bar.
-   It will iterate through all the items in the list, hiding those that do not match the search text and showing those that do.

### `_on_item_selection_changed` Method

-   This method will be updated to manage the display of selected items in the dedicated area.
-   When an item is checked, a corresponding tag with a deselect button will be added to the selected items area.
-   When an item is unchecked, its tag will be removed from the selected items area.

### Deselection

-   Each tag representing a selected item will have a small 'x' button.
-   Clicking this button will uncheck the corresponding item in the main list widget, which will in turn trigger its removal from the selected items area.

## 2. Implementation Steps

1.  Modify the `__init__` method of `MultiSelectComboBox` to include the new search bar and selected items display area.
2.  Implement the `_filter_items` method.
3.  Update the `_on_item_selection_changed` method to manage the selected items display.
4.  Implement the deselection functionality.
5.  Test the component thoroughly.
