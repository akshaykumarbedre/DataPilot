### 1. Separate Data Storage for Doctor Findings and Patient Problems
- Doctor findings and patient problems should have distinct data storage
- Both should be separate in the database implementation
- Use `record_type = Column(String(20), nullable=False)` with values:
    - `'patient_problem'`
    - `'doctor_finding'`
- This enables independent storage and retrieval for each record type

## Requirements:
- Patient problems and doctor findings should display different data in UI
- Updates to patient problems should NOT automatically update doctor findings
- Updates to doctor findings should NOT automatically update patient problems  
- Enable storing different values for the same tooth in both dental chat and doctor findings
- Maintain independent data streams for each record type
